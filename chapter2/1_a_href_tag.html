    <h1 id="alpha">Alpha /ˈælfə/[1] (uppercase Α, lowercase α; Ancient Greek: ἄλφα, álpha, modern pronunciation álfa) is the first letter of the Greek alphabet. 
        In the system of Greek numerals, it has a value of 1.
        It is derived from the Phoenician letter aleph Aleph - an ox.[2]
        Letters that arose from alpha include the Latin A and the Cyrillic letter А.
        In English, the noun "alpha" is used as a synonym for "beginning", or "first" (in a series), reflecting its Greek roots.[</h1>

        <h1 id="beta">Beta /uppercase Β, lowercase β, or cursive ϐ; Ancient Greek: βῆτα, romanized: bē̂ta or Greek: βήτα, romanized: víta) 
        is the second letter of the Greek alphabet. 
        In the system of Greek numerals it has a value of 2. 
        In Ancient Greek, beta represented the voiced bilabial plosive /b/. 
        In Modern Greek, it represents the voiced labiodental fricative /v/ 
        (while /b/ in foreign words is instead commonly transcribed as μπ). 
        Letters that arose from beta include the Roman letter ⟨B⟩ and the Cyrillic letters ⟨Б⟩ and ⟨В⟩.</h1>
